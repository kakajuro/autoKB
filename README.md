## Introduction
> I was inspired to do this when I first saw pytesseract. 
> This project is able to type based on what letters it sees on the screen. 
> This program was designed for the type test at [this](https://www.livechat.com/typing-speed-test/#/) site. 
> The image recognition is not 100% accurate but it works well.
